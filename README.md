# Electoral-BasketBall-League
This program takes a list of children and puts them into a basketball league. Those who are younger get put in the league first and those
who are older get put in second based on two separate criterias. It then takes any inelligible players and any players who couldn't get in 
the league and prints their names and ages in an ordered list.

This program uses a priority queue to accomplish it's goal.
